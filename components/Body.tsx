                    <p> I've been working with amazing women like you for the past three years. Here's my "why." </p>
        
                    <p> Going from 0 to 100mph in two short months made me a believer in coaching. So I set out on my 
                        own journey to be that person for others. Three years later, I've helped over 150 women regain
                        their inner strength, vitality, and femininity. Through one-on-one coaching sessions, online programs
                        , video conferences, webinars, and written content, I've been fortunate enough to connect with unbelievable
                        females across the globe. </p>
        
                    <p> And the journey is only beginning... </p>
